- For all instructions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision

## Memory rules
- Use `git status` to check for changes to the source code made outside of your context window

## Git Branch Rules

- You are only to make commits to the `robo-cowbell` branch.
- you are permitted to pull from the master branch and merge that into the `robo-cowbell` branch.
